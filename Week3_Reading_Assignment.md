# Reading Assignment Week 3

Geoff Boeing’s two reports using OSMnx exemplify how efficient mapping techniques can aid planners in practice. The OSMnx mapping method, described in “OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks,” uses data from different sources, such as OpenStreetMap, to easily download and analyze street grids as well as easily put maps into code. Boeing’s “Off the Grid… and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design” discussed how our forms of transportation have shaped the street networks we use, from interconnected grids in the 1900s to completely disconnected grids in the 1990s and how these changes are connected to automobile usage. Additionally, Boeing identifies the relationship between lower vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and walkability with the types of streets. As a transportation planner, using this tool to further understand the relationships is crucial in order to potentially shape street networks to create a less auto-centric city. I also found it very interesting how much topography plays into the equation for development. As noted in the report, street grids are difficult to change, however, given that they have changed so much in the past century, I wonder if and how the street grids will change if recent travel patterns continue. 

On that note, I am curious to hear how Boeing thinks street networks will change in the next century? Another question I had relates to OSMnx and if there is a way to use the OSMnx street network for hypotheticals such as a new road, path, or bike lane?
