## Questions: 
Were there any instances where there was interference with the GPS data? Such as if a car entered an underground lot and could no longer transmit the signal? 

I did not notice any note of one-way street traffic, could one-way streets increase the cruising distance or time (particularly in San Francisco)? If so, how did you account for the one-way streets?
