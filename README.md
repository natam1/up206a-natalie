A second-year MURP concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning hoping to learn some coding skills that I can apply to my capstone project

Project Outline: Transportation Finance at the Local Level 
   * city funding trends and city spending trends as it relates to transportation. 
   * What types of transportation do cities invest in? Streets and Roads? Transit? How does this relate to the demographics of the city and the transportation types that the majoriity of people in that city use?
