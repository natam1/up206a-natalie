Ben Welsh's closing keynote

This week I attended Ben Welshâ€™s closing keynote speech at the 4th Annual Humanitarian Mapathon. Welsh talked about the different ways that data can be displayed visually; through application, Visual Stories and Digital Designs. He gave examples of how each of these can be utilized to tell a particular story. The example that stood out the most to me was the Homicide Report, and how the LA Times repurposed it from the original form in 2010 to show the deaths caused by the police force. This type of visual tools is very impactful because it can go further than a written report can by showing the concentrations of incidents and the disparities between the different regions of the county. I also found the Hurricane Harvey mapping story to be quite interesting, given that the regions that maps identified as high risk were not the ones to experience damages. These are just two examples that show how important mapping data can be, especially when creating policies.
